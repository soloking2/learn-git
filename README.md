Every part of a network is called a node (devices).
Whatever that is used to connect to a node is called communication media e.g wifi, router, cables, waves, fibre optics etc.
All computer networks are made up of communication media and nodes (the devices connected).

A workstation is a main name for all home computers e.g. laptops, desktops etc.
